# the-war-is-wrong
I hope the Russian Ukrainian war will end as soon as possible, otherwise it may trigger the Third World Warï¼ŒThe media reports are political, and most people's votes can reflect the actual situation. I also hope bitcoin can record this event. The more wars, the further destruction of mankind. The bitcoin voted this time will be donated to the reconstruction of post-war Ukraine. I do not intend to donate bitcoin to the army of any party.
